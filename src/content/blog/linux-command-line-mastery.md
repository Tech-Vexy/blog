## Essential Commands

### File and Directory Operations

```bash
# List files and directories
ls              # Basic listing
ls -l           # Detailed listing
ls -la          # Include hidden files
ls -lh          # Human-readable file sizes
ls -lt          # Sort by modification time

# Navigate directories
pwd             # Print current directory
cd /path/to/dir # Change directory
cd ..           # Go up one directory
cd ~            # Go to home directory
cd -            # Go to previous directory

# Create and remove directories
mkdir directory_name
mkdir -p path/to/nested/dir  # Create parent directories
rmdir directory_name         # Remove empty directory
rm -rf directory_name        # Remove directory and contents

# File operations
touch filename.txt           # Create empty file
cp source.txt destination.txt # Copy file
cp -r source_dir dest_dir    # Copy directory recursively
mv oldname.txt newname.txt   # Move/rename file
rm filename.txt              # Remove file
rm -i filename.txt           # Remove with confirmation
```

### File Content Operations

```bash
# View file contents
cat filename.txt             # Display entire file
less filename.txt            # View file page by page
head filename.txt            # Show first 10 lines
head -n 20 filename.txt      # Show first 20 lines
tail filename.txt            # Show last 10 lines
tail -f logfile.txt          # Follow file changes (logs)

# Search within files
grep "pattern" filename.txt
grep -r "pattern" directory/  # Recursive search
grep -i "pattern" file.txt    # Case insensitive
grep -n "pattern" file.txt    # Show line numbers
grep -v "pattern" file.txt    # Invert match (exclude)

# File editing
nano filename.txt            # Simple text editor
vim filename.txt             # Advanced editor
emacs filename.txt           # Another advanced editor
```

### File Permissions and Ownership

```bash
# Understanding permissions
# Format: rwx rwx rwx (owner, group, others)
# r = read (4), w = write (2), x = execute (1)

ls -l filename.txt
# -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 Jan 20 10:00 filename.txt

# Change permissions
chmod 755 script.sh          # rwx r-x r-x
chmod +x script.sh           # Add execute permission
chmod -w filename.txt        # Remove write permission
chmod u+x,g-w,o-r file.txt   # Complex permission changes

# Change ownership
chown user:group filename.txt
chown -R user:group directory/  # Recursive ownership change
```

## Text Processing and Manipulation

### Powerful Text Tools

```bash
# Sort and unique
sort filename.txt            # Sort lines alphabetically
sort -n numbers.txt          # Sort numerically
sort -r filename.txt         # Reverse sort
uniq filename.txt            # Remove duplicate lines
sort filename.txt | uniq     # Sort and remove duplicates

# Cut and paste
cut -d',' -f1 data.csv       # Extract first column from CSV
cut -c1-10 filename.txt      # Extract characters 1-10
paste file1.txt file2.txt    # Merge files side by side

# String manipulation
wc filename.txt              # Word, line, character count
wc -l filename.txt           # Line count only
tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < file.txt    # Convert lowercase to uppercase
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt   # Replace text
awk '{print $1}' file.txt    # Print first column
```

### Regular Expressions with grep

```bash
# Basic patterns
grep "^start" file.txt       # Lines starting with "start"
grep "end$" file.txt         # Lines ending with "end"
grep "^$" file.txt           # Empty lines
grep "[0-9]" file.txt        # Lines containing numbers
grep "colou?r" file.txt      # Match "color" or "colour"

# Advanced patterns
grep -E "pattern1|pattern2" file.txt  # OR operation
grep -E "^[A-Z]" file.txt            # Lines starting with uppercase
grep -E "\b[0-9]{3}\b" file.txt      # Three-digit numbers
```

## Advanced Command Line Features

### Pipes and Redirection

```bash
# Pipes (|) - send output of one command to another
ls -l | grep "txt"              # List files, filter for .txt
cat file.txt | grep "error" | wc -l  # Count error lines
ps aux | grep "python" | head -5     # Find Python processes

# Redirection
command > output.txt            # Redirect stdout to file
command >> output.txt           # Append stdout to file
command 2> error.txt            # Redirect stderr to file
command &> output.txt           # Redirect both stdout and stderr
command < input.txt             # Use file as input
```

### Command Substitution

```bash
# Use command output as argument
echo "Today is $(date)"
files=$(ls *.txt)
echo "Text files: $files"

# Store command output in variable
current_dir=$(pwd)
file_count=$(ls | wc -l)
echo "Directory $current_dir has $file_count files"
```

alias grep='grep --color=auto'

# Make aliases permanent by adding to ~/.bashrc
echo "alias ll='ls -la'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Create functions for complex operations
function mkcd() {
    mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}

function backup() {
    cp "$1" "$1.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
}

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple backup script

# Variables
SOURCE_DIR="/home/user/documents"
BACKUP_DIR="/home/user/backups"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Create backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE.tar.gz" "$SOURCE_DIR"

# Remove backups older than 7 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "backup_*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -delete

echo "Backup completed: backup_$DATE.tar.gz"
```

### Making Scripts Executable
```bash
chmod +x script.sh           # Make script executable
./script.sh                  # Run script
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

```bash
# Permission denied
ls -la filename              # Check permissions
sudo chown user:group filename  # Change ownership
chmod +x filename            # Add execute permission

# Command not found
which command_name           # Check if command exists
echo $PATH                   # Check PATH variable
sudo apt install package_name  # Install missing package

# Process using port
lsof -i :8080               # Find process using port 8080
kill -9 process_id          # Force kill process

# Disk space issues
df -h                       # Check disk usage
du -sh * | sort -h          # Find largest directories
find /path -type f -size +100M  # Find large files
```
