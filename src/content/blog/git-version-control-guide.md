As a Computer Systems Engineering student, mastering Git and version control is absolutely essential. Whether you're working on solo projects or collaborating with teams, version control systems help you track changes, manage different versions of your code, and collaborate effectively with other developers.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to:
- Track the history of your project
- Revert to previous versions when needed
- Collaborate with multiple developers
- Manage different versions or branches of your code
- Understand who made specific changes and when

## Why Git?

Git is the most widely used version control system for several reasons:
- **Distributed**: Every developer has a complete copy of the project history
- **Fast**: Local operations are lightning-fast
- **Flexible**: Supports various workflows and branching strategies
- **Reliable**: Built-in data integrity and backup mechanisms
- **Industry Standard**: Used by virtually every tech company

## Git Fundamentals

### Basic Git Workflow

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt
git add .  # Add all files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add initial project files"

# Check status
git status

# View commit history
git log
git log --oneline  # Compact view
```

### Understanding Git States

Your files can be in one of three states:
1. **Modified**: Changed but not staged
2. **Staged**: Ready to be committed
3. **Committed**: Safely stored in Git history

```bash
# Check which files are in which state
git status

# See differences between working directory and staging area
git diff

# See differences between staging area and last commit
git diff --staged
```

## Essential Git Commands

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git

# View remote repositories
git remote -v
```

### Daily Workflow Commands
```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Add specific files
git add file1.txt file2.txt

# Add all modified files
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Fix login validation bug"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

### Branching and Merging
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Switch between branches
git checkout main
git checkout feature/user-authentication

# List all branches
git branch
git branch -r  # Remote branches

# Merge branch into current branch
git merge feature/user-authentication

# Delete branch
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

## Branching Strategies

### Git Flow
A popular branching model for larger projects:

```bash
# Main branches
main/master    # Production-ready code
develop        # Latest development changes

# Supporting branches
feature/       # New features
release/       # Prepare for production release
hotfix/        # Quick fixes to production

# Example workflow
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration
# Work on feature
git checkout develop
git merge feature/payment-integration
git branch -d feature/payment-integration
```

### GitHub Flow
A simpler approach for continuous deployment:

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard

# Work on feature and push regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Add dashboard components"
git push origin feature/new-dashboard

# Create pull request on GitHub
# After review and approval, merge to main
```

## Handling Conflicts

When multiple developers modify the same file, conflicts can occur:

```bash
# When pulling changes results in conflicts
git pull origin main
# Auto-merging failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

# Open conflicted files and look for conflict markers
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Other developer's changes
>>>>>>> commit-hash

# Edit the file to resolve conflicts
# Then stage and commit the resolved file
git add resolved-file.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in resolved-file.txt"
```

## Advanced Git Techniques

### Stashing Changes
```bash
# Temporarily save changes without committing
git stash

# List stashed changes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash apply

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{1}

# Drop a stash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

### Rewriting History
```bash
# Interactive rebase to modify commit history
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Amend the last commit
git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"

# Reset to previous commit (be careful!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Loses changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Keeps changes staged
```

### Cherry-picking
```bash
# Apply specific commit to current branch
git cherry-pick commit-hash

# Apply multiple commits
git cherry-pick commit1 commit2 commit3
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add user authentication middleware"
git commit -m "Fix memory leak in image processing"
git commit -m "Update README with installation instructions"

# Bad commit messages
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "asdf"
```

### Commit Frequency
- Commit often with small, logical changes
- Each commit should represent a single, complete change
- Don't commit broken code to shared branches

### Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
```bash
# Good branch names
feature/user-profile
bugfix/login-validation
hotfix/security-patch

# Bad branch names
branch1
temp
my-changes
```

## Git Configuration

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Set your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set default editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
git config --global core.editor "nano"         # Nano

# Set default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

### Useful Aliases
```bash
# Create shortcuts for common commands
git config --global alias.st status
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'

# Now you can use
git st    # instead of git status
git co    # instead of git checkout
```

## Working with Remote Repositories

### GitHub Workflow
```bash
# Fork a repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repository.git

# Keep your fork updated
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

### SSH Keys for GitHub
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## .gitignore Files

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

```bash
# .gitignore for a Python project
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/
.eggs/
lib/
lib64/
parts/
sdist/
var/
wheels/
*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg

# Virtual environments
venv/
env/
ENV/

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
```

## Git Hooks

Automate tasks with Git hooks:

```bash
# Pre-commit hook example (.git/hooks/pre-commit)
#!/bin/sh
# Run tests before each commit
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Undoing Changes
```bash
# Discard changes in working directory
git checkout -- filename.txt

# Unstage files
git reset HEAD filename.txt

# Revert a commit (creates new commit)
git revert commit-hash

# Reset to previous commit (dangerous)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Recovering Lost Work
```bash
# View all commits (including deleted ones)
git reflog

# Recover lost commit
git checkout commit-hash
git checkout -b recovered-branch
```

## Team Collaboration

### Pull Request Best Practices
1. **Small, focused changes**: Keep PRs small and focused
2. **Clear descriptions**: Explain what and why you changed
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your changes work
4. **Responsive reviews**: Address feedback promptly

### Code Review Guidelines
```bash
# Before requesting review
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main  # Keep history clean

# Self-review checklist
# - Code follows style guidelines
# - Tests are included and passing
# - Documentation is updated
# - No debug code or commented-out code
```
