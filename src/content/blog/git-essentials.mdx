# What is Git And Version Control
**Version Control** is the management of changes made in a system. Version Control tools like Git provide:
       - **Reversibility** - The ability to return to any point in history of the source code.
       - **Concurrency** - The ability to allow several people to make changes on the same project.
       - **Annotation** - Additional explanation of the changes made at any point.
**Git** is a distributed or decentralized version control system i.e each developer has a copy of the repository.

# Installing Git

Git can be installed by following the guide on the main [website](https://git-scm.com/)

## Platform-Specific Installation

### Windows
Download the Git installer from the official website and run it. The installer includes Git Bash, which provides a Unix-like command line interface.

### macOS
Git comes pre-installed on macOS, but you can install the latest version using:
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install git

# Using MacPorts
sudo port install git
```

### Linux
Use your distribution's package manager:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo yum install git
# or for newer versions
sudo dnf install git

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S git
```

## Initial Configuration
After installation, configure Git with your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

# Basic Usage

## Creating a Repository
Start tracking a project with Git:
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

## The Three States of Git
Git has three main states that files can be in:
- **Working Directory**: Files you're currently editing
- **Staging Area**: Files prepared for the next commit
- **Repository**: Committed files in the Git database

## Essential Commands

### Checking Status
```bash
git status
```
Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

### Adding Files
```bash
# Add a specific file
git add filename.txt

# Add all files
git add .

# Add all files with specific extension
git add *.js
```

### Committing Changes
```bash
# Commit with message
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "Add user authentication" -m "Implements login and logout functionality"

# Stage and commit in one command
git commit -am "Fix bug in user validation"
```

### Viewing History
```bash
# View commit history
git log

# Compact one-line view
git log --oneline

# Graph view
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

### Undoing Changes
```bash
# Unstage a file
git reset filename.txt

# Discard changes in working directory
git checkout -- filename.txt

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

# Branching

Branching is one of Git's most powerful features, allowing you to work on different features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

## Branch Concepts
- **Branch**: A movable pointer to a specific commit
- **HEAD**: Points to the current branch you're working on
- **main/master**: The default primary branch

## Branch Operations

### Creating and Switching Branches
```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-login

# Switch to a branch
git checkout feature-login

# Create and switch in one command
git checkout -b feature-login

# Using newer syntax (Git 2.23+)
git switch -c feature-login
```

### Listing Branches
```bash
# List local branches
git branch

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# List remote branches
git branch -r
```

### Merging Branches
```bash
# Switch to target branch
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature-login

# Merge with no fast-forward (creates merge commit)
git merge --no-ff feature-login
```

### Deleting Branches
```bash
# Delete merged branch
git branch -d feature-login

# Force delete unmerged branch
git branch -D feature-login

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature-login
```

## Merge Conflicts
When Git can't automatically merge changes, you'll need to resolve conflicts manually:

```bash
# After a conflict occurs
git status  # Shows conflicted files

# Edit conflicted files, then:
git add conflicted-file.txt
git commit
```

# Remote Repositories

Remote repositories enable collaboration by storing your code on external servers like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

## Working with Remotes

### Adding Remotes
```bash
# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git

# List remotes
git remote -v

# Show remote information
git remote show origin
```

### Fetching and Pulling
```bash
# Fetch changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Pull changes and merge
git pull origin main

# Pull with rebase
git pull --rebase origin main
```

### Pushing Changes
```bash
# Push to remote branch
git push origin main

# Push new branch to remote
git push -u origin feature-branch

# Push all branches
git push --all origin

# Force push (use with caution)
git push --force origin main
```

### Tracking Branches
```bash
# Create local branch tracking remote
git checkout -b feature-branch origin/feature-branch

# Set upstream for existing branch
git push -u origin feature-branch

# Check tracking relationships
git branch -vv
```

# Patches

Patches allow you to share changes as files, useful for email-based workflows or when you can't directly push to a repository.

## Creating Patches
```bash
# Create patch for last commit
git format-patch HEAD~1

# Create patch for specific commit
git format-patch -1 <commit-hash>

# Create patch for range of commits
git format-patch main..feature-branch

# Create patch with custom name
git format-patch -1 <commit-hash> -o patches/
```

## Applying Patches
```bash
# Apply patch file
git apply 0001-patch-file.patch

# Apply patch with commit information
git am 0001-patch-file.patch

# Apply patch with three-way merge
git am -3 0001-patch-file.patch

# Check what a patch would do
git apply --check 0001-patch-file.patch
```

## Patch Best Practices
- Keep patches focused on single changes
- Include descriptive commit messages
- Test patches before sharing
- Use `git format-patch` for email workflows

# Cherry Picking

Cherry picking allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another, useful for backporting fixes or selectively applying changes.

## Basic Cherry Picking
```bash
# Cherry pick a single commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Cherry pick multiple commits
git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>

# Cherry pick a range of commits
git cherry-pick <start-commit>..<end-commit>
```

## Cherry Pick Options
```bash
# Cherry pick without committing
git cherry-pick -n <commit-hash>

# Cherry pick with custom message
git cherry-pick -e <commit-hash>

# Cherry pick and sign off
git cherry-pick -s <commit-hash>

# Continue after resolving conflicts
git cherry-pick --continue

# Abort cherry pick
git cherry-pick --abort
```

## Use Cases
- **Hotfixes**: Apply critical bug fixes to multiple branches
- **Feature Backporting**: Bring specific features to older versions
- **Selective Integration**: Choose specific improvements from feature branches

# Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow, enabling automation and enforcing project standards.

## Types of Hooks

### Client-Side Hooks
- **pre-commit**: Runs before commit is created
- **prepare-commit-msg**: Runs before commit message editor
- **commit-msg**: Validates commit messages
- **post-commit**: Runs after commit is created
- **pre-push**: Runs before pushing to remote

### Server-Side Hooks
- **pre-receive**: Runs before accepting push
- **update**: Runs for each branch being updated
- **post-receive**: Runs after accepting push

## Setting Up Hooks
Hooks are stored in `.git/hooks/` directory:

```bash
# Make hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Example pre-commit hook
#!/bin/sh
# Run tests before commit
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
```

## Common Hook Examples

### Pre-commit Hook for Code Quality
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Check code formatting
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Linting failed. Please fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi

# Run tests
npm test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed. Commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Commit Message Hook
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Check commit message format
commit_regex='^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}'
if ! grep -qE "$commit_regex" "$1"; then
  echo "Invalid commit message format!"
  echo "Use: type(scope): description"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Hook Management Tools
- **Husky**: Popular Node.js hook manager
- **pre-commit**: Python-based hook framework
- **Overcommit**: Ruby-based hook manager

# Continuous Integration Approaches

Git integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Git-Based CI/CD Workflows

### Feature Branch Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Develop and commit changes
3. Push branch to remote
4. Create pull/merge request
5. CI runs tests automatically
6. Code review and approval
7. Merge to main
8. Deploy from main branch

### Git Flow
A branching model with specific branch purposes:
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch
- **feature/***: New features
- **release/***: Release preparation
- **hotfix/***: Emergency fixes

### GitHub Flow
Simplified workflow:
1. Create branch from main
2. Add commits
3. Open pull request
4. Discuss and review
5. Merge and deploy

## CI/CD Integration Strategies

### Branch-Based Deployment
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

### Tag-Based Releases
```bash
# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# CI triggers deployment on tag push
```

### Environment Branching
- **main**: Production environment
- **staging**: Staging environment
- **develop**: Development environment

## Best Practices for CI/CD with Git

### Commit Standards
- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Include tests with feature commits
- Use meaningful branch names

### Branch Protection
- Require pull request reviews
- Enforce status checks
- Prevent direct pushes to main
- Require up-to-date branches

### Automated Quality Gates
- Run tests on all pull requests
- Perform code quality checks
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance regression testing

### Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Two identical environments
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual rollout to subset of users
- **Rolling Deployment**: Update instances one at a time
- **Feature Flags**: Control feature visibility

## Advanced CI/CD Patterns

### Multi-Stage Pipelines
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security-scan
  - deploy-staging
  - integration-tests
  - deploy-production
```

### Matrix Builds
Test across multiple environments:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [14, 16, 18]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]
```

### Conditional Deployments
```yaml
# Deploy only on specific conditions
if: |
  github.event_name == 'push' &&
  github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &&
  !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]')
```
